She received her BA from Universidad Nacional de Cuyo (2013), her MA in Hispanic Studies from Louisiana State University (2016), and her MA in Spanish from The Pennsylvania State University (2019). Her professional experience includes administrative positions such as content supervisor for Spanish 2 and 3 at Penn State, and several teaching positions in undergraduate level courses of Linguistics, written comprehension, and foreign language teaching (Spanish and Italian). Her research experience includes translation, bilingualism, the comparison of L2 learners and heritage speakers, the bilingual lexicon, and acquisition of L2 vocabulary and phonology. She is also interested in the cognitive aspects of bilingual language processing and second language acquisition. She is currently a doctoral student in Spanish and Language Science and a Teaching Assistant at The Pennsylvania State University.</p>

        Jessica Vélez Avilés is a graduate student in the Department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese at Penn State University, where she specializes in Hispanic Linguistics and Psycholinguistics. She earned her B.A. in Spanish Education from the University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras. Jessica also completed an M.A. in General Linguistics in the same institution. Her research interests include bilingualism, Spanish-English code-switching, psycholinguistics, second language acquisition, and language contact. Ongoing research includes bilingual language acquisition and processing, and quantitative analyses of Puerto Rican code-switched data from oral, written, and comprehension (eye-tracking) tasks. Her interests have revolved around bilingualism and Spanish-English code-switching, so, here at Penn State, she plans to further study this topic integrating psycholinguistic methods that allow her to better understand the mental processes underlying bilingual ability. Jessica spends her free time enjoying the simple pleasures of everyday life, like reading a novel, taking a walk, or having a good conversation with a friend.
