      <p>Katrina is the lab manager and research coordinator for the Dussias Brain Tracking Lab, where she manages both the lab itself and the research that goes on within it.  She received her BA in Linguistics and Chinese from the University of Maryland and followed that up with an MA in Second Language Acquisition from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Combining her interests in second language acquisition and Chinese, she completed her PhD in Linguistics at the University of Kansas in 2017 with a dissertation on the use of Chinese tones in second language spoken word recognition.  Her research interests focus on the use of suprasegmental information in spoken word recognition, primarily using visual world eye tracking.</p>

      <p>Laura is a postdoctoral scholar at Professor Paola Dussias’ Lab. She received her MA from Kobe City University of Foreign Studies and her PhD from the Autonomous University of Madrid, in collaboration with Hiroshima University. Her research interests are specially focused on sentence production by monolingual and bilingual speakers. During her years in Japan, she focused on exploring cross-linguistic differences on sentence planning in typologically distant languages. Currently, she works with Spanish-English bilinguals, exploring sentence production on code-switching.</p>
